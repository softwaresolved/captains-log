# Join me on a journey to strange new worlds
With over thirty years software development experience under my belt, there is still a lot to learn.  I have spent the last several years selling my skills to the highest bidder as a contract solution designer or architect, I have always tried to keep current, always tried to keep the developer in me alive.  Admittedly contract solution architects in the UK are well paid, and sometimes we get to do work we can be proud of, but mostly we set things up and move on. A relentless treadmill of solving other peoples problems, setting them up do do things right and hoping that someone listened. I have fifteen years or so until retirement, the kids have all grown up and left home, so it's time to do things differently.

## I'm going to develop some Software as a Service products for real
[So], now its time to take stock, to reflect on software architecture and design principles and practice and to put in all to work for myself, hopefully some of my musings will help you,  hopefully I'll learn a lot. One thing is for sure, I need the products we are going to build to be useful enough for real people to pay real money to use them.  Theese products need to pay their way, and they need to pay me for a few retirement extras.

## We aren't going to change the world
We are not trying to build the next world beating wonder app, most of what we have in mind is already out there in one form or other. A lot of what we are going to build is based on very old analysis patterns. But, we are going to build robust, scalable software and all the gubbins required to monitor, support and sell it as a service to real paying customers, and we will probably have to do some marketing and sales work along the way.
